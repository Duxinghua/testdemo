"比特派基于HD钱包(Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet)技术和多重签名(Multi-"
"Signature)技术,用户买卖数字货币基于区块链—意味着用户自身控制数字货币私钥—而不是被'平台'或其他方控制.同时,比特派也不保管用户的法币(人民币),不存在'法币充值提现'的业务,用户交易完成后,所有法币债权债务都会结清,'禁止提钱'的事情也不会发生.所以比特派比其他类似产品更加重视用户的资产安全."

"Biepit is based on Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet and Multi-Signature "
"technology and user can buy or sell digital currency upon the "
"Blockchain,which mean that the private key of digital currency could be "
"controlled by user’s own rather than by 'platform' or others’ party. At "
"the same time, the Bitpie won’t keep the user's Fait (RMB), so there is "
"no 'Fait Top Up and Withdrawal' business. Once the user’s transaction "
"completes, the creditor's rights and liabilities of Fait will be settled "
"and 'Prohibit withdrawal' issue won’t happen. All in all, Bitpie must "
"attaches more importance to the user's asset security than other similar "
"platforms."
